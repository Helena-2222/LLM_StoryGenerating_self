[Prologue]: The year 2100. New Atlantis is on the brink of a power blackout. 
[Current Scene]: Nova has just stolen a physical hard drive—the only one containing the codes to the surface—and is hiding in a derelict server farm in the Deep-Water zone. Kael has been hired to protect her, unaware that Sector is personally leading a "Cleanup" squad to recover the drive. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and damp rust.
